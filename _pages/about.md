I'm Md Zia ullah, working as a Lecturer in the School of Computing at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, UK since November 2022.

Before, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher under the supervision of the [Professor Josiane Mothe](https://www.irit.fr/~Josiane.Mothe/) at Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse ([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/ "Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)")) from 2017 to 2022, Toulouse, France. 

Before that, I achieved my Ph.D. under the supversion of the [Professor Masaki Aono](https://www.kde.cs.tut.ac.jp/%7Eaono/) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/introduction/department03.html) from the [Toyohashi University of Technology (TUT)](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/index.html) in 2016, Toyohashi, Japan. I was a member of [KDE Laboratory](https://www.kde.cs.tut.ac.jp/en/) from 2011 to 2016. My PhD thesis title was "Bipartite Graph-based Ranking Methods for Subtopic Mining and Genetic Disease Prediction."

I'm interested in theoretical and practical information retrieval (IR) problems, Natural language processing as well as applied machine learning for large-scale predictive problems. My research focuses on Adaptive Information Retrieval (IR), Query Performance Prediction (QPP), Retrieval-augmented generation, Check-worthy claim prediciton (Fake-news), Intent Mining and Result Diversification, Pseudo Relevance Feedback, Bipartite Graph for modelling and ranking, Representation learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
