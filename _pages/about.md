I'm Zia ullah, working as a Lecturer in the School of Computing at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, UK.

Before, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher under the supervision of the [Professor Josiane Mothe](https://www.irit.fr/~Josiane.Mothe/) at Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse ([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/ "Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)")). I achieved my Ph.D. under the supversion of the [Professor Masaki Aono](https://www.kde.cs.tut.ac.jp/%7Eaono/) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/introduction/department03.html) from the [Toyohashi University of Technology (TUT)](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/index.html), Japan in 2016. I was a member of [KDE Laboratory](https://www.kde.cs.tut.ac.jp/en/) from 2011 to 2016. My PhD thesis title was "Bipartite Graph-based Ranking Methods for Subtopic Mining and Genetic Disease Prediction."

I'm interested in theoretical and practical information retrieval (IR) problems, as well as applied machine learning for large-scale predictive problems. My research focuses on Adaptive Information Retrieval (IR), Query Performance Prediction (QPP), Check-worthy claim prediciton (Fake-news), Intent Mining and Result Diversification, Pseudo Relevance Feedback, Bipartite Graph for modelling and ranking, Representation learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
