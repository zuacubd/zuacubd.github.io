I'm Md Zia ullah, has been working as a Lecturer in the Computer Sciene group of SCEBE at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, UK since November 2022.

Before, I was a post-doctoral researcher with [Professor Josiane Mothe](https://www.irit.fr/~Josiane.Mothe/) at Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse ([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/ "Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)")) from 2017 to 2022, Toulouse, France. I researched in Information retrieval, Machine learning, and Natural language processing. In 2016, I achieved my Ph.D. under the supversion of [Professor Masaki Aono](https://www.kde.cs.tut.ac.jp/%7Eaono/) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/introduction/department03.html) from the [Toyohashi University of Technology (TUT)](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/index.html), Toyohashi, Japan. My PhD thesis title was "Bipartite Graph-based Ranking Methods for Subtopic Mining and Genetic Disease Prediction."

My research interests are in theoretical and practical information retrieval (IR) problems, Natural language processing (NLP) as well as applied machine learning/deep learning for large-scale predictive problems. 

My research focuses on Query Performance Prediction (QPP), Clarification need prediction, Adaptive Information Retrieval (AIR), Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), Check-worthiness and Fake news in LLM Era, and Intent Mining and Result Diversification.
